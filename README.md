============================================

copperegg-engineyard
===========
* Chef cookbook for installing the CopperEgg collector agent on the Engine Yard Cloud.
* Requires a CopperEgg account to use. [Free trial available](https://app.copperegg.com/signup).

Requirements
============
bash

Platform
========
* This cookbook should only be used when deploying the CopperEgg collector on the Engine Yard Cloud.
* It was created in conformance with the Engine Yard documentation for Custom Chef Recipes, (see links below).

Attributes
==========
* `[:copperegg][:apikey]` = Your User API Key available from the [RevealCloud App Settings Page](https://app.copperegg.com/#settings/user).
* `[:copperegg][:tags]` = A comma separated list of tags to apply.  Optional.  [Manage your tags](https://app.copperegg.com/#revealcloud/tags).
* `[:copperegg][:label]` = Label to apply in place of hostname when displaying in the dashboard.  WARNING: If you want the same label applied to multiple systems, you may want to consider tags instead.  This is most useful if you intend a recipe for a single server.  Optional.
* `[:copperegg][:proxy]` = Proxy server required to talk to the revealcloud api servers, such as `myproxy.mycorp.com:8080`.  Optional.  Leave blank unless you know what you are doing.
